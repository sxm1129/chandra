<h2>Animal Rights Assaults</h2>
<h3>Activists Aim to Skin the Fur Industry</h3>
<p>By ROBERT W. GIBSON, Times International Correspondent</p>
<p>HILVERSUM, Netherlands—For furrier Machiel de Groot, plying his trade is pure hell.</p>
<p>After six years of tumult led by animal rights activists, fur clothing has virtually disappeared in this country, nearly 400 furriers have dwindled to just 32, and for all practical purposes Holland has become the industrialized world's first "fur-free" society.</p>
<p>Americans who believe the wearing of furs means cruelty to animals look to this country as a model. They have forged a working relationship with the Dutch anti-fur lobby and view them as mentors and heroes.</p>
<p>But De Groot, 49, liones existence for Dutch furriers today is left of Holland.</p>
<p>"Twice—twice—stones have shattered my [store's] front window," he declares.</p>
<p>"Excrement has been put in my mailbox so many times I have to lock it."</p>
<p>"Once red paint was smeared all over the doorway—for a symbol of blood!"</p>
<h3>Worse Has Happened</h3>
<p>Even worse has happened, says De Groot, who from this town a few miles from Amsterdam serves as a spokesman for what is left of Holland's furriers.</p>
<p>"A gang of children chased a furrier's son and threw him in the water. It's happened before. Teachers indoctrinate the students, then the students sometimes go too far."</p>
<p>"In train stations, at the airport, anywhere, women... get taunted. A schoolteacher for wearing fur. A student for having three in the furrier's car and three in his own."</p>
<p>It's happened before. Teachers indoctrinate the students, then the students sometimes go too far.</p>
